\title{Plot a historical timeline, with time on the vertical axis}
\usage{
timelineVertical(time, event, col = "black", labelTime = "", file,
  cex = par("cex"), fraction = 0.5, debug = 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{time}{Vector of times, or character strings that can be coerced into times
using \code{\link[lubridate]{ymd}}, e.g. \code{"2019-06-30"} or \code{"20190630"}
for May 30, 2019. The times need not be in order, because they (and the \code{event}
and \code{col} values) are all put into temporal order by this function.}

\item{event}{Vector of (brief) strings indicating what happened at the indicated times.
The number of entries must match the number of times.}

\item{col}{Vector of colours to use for the events. This will be lengthened
to match the length of \code{time}.}

\item{labelTime}{String used to label the time axis. The default is to
not label the axis, which saves some margin space to the left of the plot.}

\item{file}{Optional string giving the name of a comma-separated-value
file, to be read by \code{\link{read.csv}}, that possibly contains columns
labelled \code{time}, \code{event}, and \code{col}. Any of these
columns that are present take precedence over the arguments of those names.}

\item{cex}{Character expansion factor for event strings. If the longest
event string will not fit within half the plot width, then \code{cex}
will be reduced to make it fit.}

\item{fraction}{Maximal fraction of plot area to devote to the event
labels.}

\item{debug}{An integer that indicates whethr to printing some information
about the processing. This can be handy if problems arise, but the
default is to work silently.}
}
\description{
The time axis appears on the left of the diagram, with lines extending from event
times to a list of labels that are right-justified at the right of the diagram. The
event label sizes are controlled by the \code{cex} argument, but if that value
would yield event labels taking more than \code{fraction} of the plot area, then the character
size is reduced so that the labels take up no more than \code{fraction} of the area. Adjusting
\code{fraction} and plot width may be required to get diagrams that are easily understood.
}
\details{
If the \code{file} argument is given, then the \code{time}, \code{event}
and \code{col} arguments need not be given, and indeed the values supplied
by those arguments will be ignored.
